# nova-lilith-os

I want to learn about operating systems so this is my toy operating system.

Goals:

- Learn about how to develop a kernel
- Learn about operating systems
- Develop a functional operating system that I can run and use for programming on one of my computers

## How to build

### Build the cross-compiler

1. `cd cross-compiler`
1. `./build.sh`
1. `cd ..`

Can I get this to build when we run `cmake .`?
I couldn't get it to work with the exec process stuff.
It looked like it wasn't running the configure commands
